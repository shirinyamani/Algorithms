# Bellman Ford Algorithm

Remember in [Dijkstra](./graph/dijkstra) section I mentioned that it is not working on Negative Cycle Graphs? So it can be solved by Bellman Ford Algorithm! ðŸ˜Ž
But always remember that whenever we have a Negative Cycle Graph, can only catch it then report it! So there would be No minimum cost path in such case!
