# Minimum Spanning Tree ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²

## What is MST?

- Collection of connected vertices **without cycle** in!
- Weighted edges
- **Goal:** find minimum cost to a target node

## Diference with SSSP?
In SSSP, we are looking for shortest path from a source node to **all** other nodes and there is a room for having a cylce; returning back to specific node over n over! However in MST, we are only looking for minimum cost, so we can't have a cycle. Take a look at img below to find out the difference;
